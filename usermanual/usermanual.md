## Type2Code
- This software provides a learning environment for students and programmers to learn code through repetition. Oftentimes, when someone is learning how to code, jumping straight into learning syntax offers a harsh learning curve. Type2Code eases this by helping users adjust to this syntax by repetitively typing and mastering specific concepts and functions in Python.
- To install the software, copy the GitHub repository with the link and paste it into your IDE with "git clone <github-link>". Then you want to start up your virtual environment in Python with "python -m venv <env-name>", followed by "source <env-name>/bin/activate" if you are on MacOS, or "<env-name>/Scripts/activate.bat" if you are on Windows. Next, to install the needed packages run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal. Lastly, you will now need to set up your Supabase database, go to this link: https://supabase.com/ and click "start your project", then follow the instructions to configure a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase, updating your environment variables with the needed keys.
- To startup the software, you will want to run "uvicorn app.main:app --reload" to startup the FastAPI backend, and "npm run dev" to startup the React.JS frontend. This will allow you to test the application in localhost:3000.
- To run the software, we will have it hosted on a publicly accessible web page, which is currently a work in progress (WIP).
