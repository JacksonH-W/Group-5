Week 7: Requirements Elicitation
Goals planned for this week:  
Get frontend pages implemented(dashboard, lessons, game, practice pages).
Implement a few Python lessons to make sure the keyboard updates correctly with what the user inputs. 

Team progress and issues:
what team did
what worked
what team learned
where team had trouble and where team is stuck

Goals planned for next week: (These are higher-level tasks for the team)
measurable task 1 and a time estimate in days.
measurable task 2 and a time estimate in days.

Contributions of individual team members
Team Member 1 (Logan Bachman):
Goals planned for this week:  
Implement testing & automation workflows
Team progress and issues:
Designed skeleton for frontend structure, and created login and registration pages with user routing based on authentication.
Communication on team responsibilities, and being able to successfully implement my feature ahead of schedule.
How to route with FastAPI’s sessions, and design a simple UI for our initial prototype.
Could have been more thorough when designing developer documentation, needed revisions after the initial draft.
Goals planned for next week: 
Design my portion of testing automation (1 day)
Create tests that provide efficient coverage (2-3 hours)

Team Member 2 (Ulises Cordova):
Goals planned for this week: 
Create a Makefile that automates the startup process 
Copy over Supabase SQL queries into the repository so that other people can reproduce our project
Functions
Schemas
Triggers
Create a YML file that automates reporting issues with our code. 
Help front-end and build a page with the user's progress using api/GET/dashboard
Team progress and issues:
I was able to complete the backend and clean up repository documents, also created a makefile that automates start, and have copied over Supabase SQL queries. 
Communication has been working well, and everyone is contributing to the project on time and before our set deadlines, as well as the class deadlines. I feel that although we may have very busy schedule,s we are not overwhelming each other with too much work too fast and progressing with purpose and sense.
I learned that you are able to run bash commands from a Makefile. Making it super easy to automate startups. 
I do not feel that I have been stuck; I only had to learn a bit about Makefiles and their possibilities. 
Goals planned for next week: 
Create test suites for code, and check for code coverage. 
Makefile that reports stats for test suites. 

Team Member 3 (Rustic Boulton):
Goals planned for this week:  
Front-end: lessons/dashboard/game pages. Figure out the layout, lesson design, and the front-end look. Implement CSS styles for all pages and maintain a consistent UI look and feel throughout our project. 
Team progress and issues:
I coded/implemented and updated multiple different frontend files(lessonsPage.jsx, practicePage.jsx, gamePage.jsx, Navbar.jsx, lessons.css, navbar.css, global.css, lessonsGrid.css, practice.css, app.jsx). 
The design for each page's layout is working nicely so far. We structured/split up the work differently this time from before. We split into two teams; two of us worked more on the coding/implementation part of the project, while the other two worked on style, design, look, and reorganization of our GitHub. 
We learned that we are not only on track with our project, but a little ahead, so we are starting to think about our stretch goal and what else we could add/implement after we are done with testing. 
A problem that I ran into was an issue with VSCode. Some files did not save, so I had to rewrite a few files. This is why we should save and push to git more often. 
Goals planned for next week: 
Polish the frontend style and add a game with a few levels that correspond to specific lessons. (3 days)
Restructure the practice mode so that it will take the user to a random lesson they have already finished(this will help them practice through repetition). (3 days).

Team Member 4 (Jackson Happel-Walvatne):
Goals planned for this week:  
None (since this is the first week) 
Team progress and issues:
what team member did
what worked
what team member learned
where team member had trouble and where team member is stuck
Goals planned for next week: 
measurable task 1 and a time estimate in days.
measurable task 2 and a time estimate in days.
