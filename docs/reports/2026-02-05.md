**Week 4: Architecture and Design Team report:**
**Goals planned for this week:**
- Implementing our software design section (asynchronously) 
- Finalize software architecture (1-2 hours) 
- Split up tasks for the following week (1 day) 
- Develop the first initial structure of the backend (3-4 days)
  
**Team progress and issues:**
- We started to set up SupaBase for our backend. First, we set up the organization and sent invitations to each group member so we can all access SupaBase’s cloud sharing application. We then split up the workload evenly for project milestone 3 documentation; each person got roughly one major section to work on. The coding section was also split up for our backend, using SupaBase’s SQL and database integration tabs. 
- Splitting up coding workload and documentation went well last week. This allowed us to get a head start on how SupaBase worked and what we needed to learn before implementing our backend. 
- Throughout this week, we learned how to use the Superbase layout and different editors within SupaBase( triggers, functions, and tables). 
- There was a little bit of miscommunication regarding the spreading work; we were able to figure it out and move forward. Moving onwards, we'll try to be a little clearer, especially with assigning tasks. We correctly split up the work amount, but we just forgot to clarify how much of each section each person did/was doing. 

**Goals planned for next week: (These are higher-level tasks for the team)**
- Finish mid-term presentation.
- Start on the front end, polish up any issues or unfinished features still outstanding with the backend.

**Contributions of individual team members:** <br>
**Team Member 1 (Logan Bachman):**<br>
**Goals planned for this week:** Implement the user authentication and registration system.  Finish the architecture section in the living document.

**Team progress and issues:**
- Planned out the architecture for the project, and was assigned a task for the backend implementation.
- Splitting up tasks between members and making sure everyone had a relatively even amount of work.
- To be clearer about how to use certain frameworks or tools we are using (Ex, Supabase).
- Exactly how to format or communicate the way the architecture is working or communicating data has been resolved.

**Goals planned for next week: (These are lower-level tasks for which this team member is accountable)**
- Work on the architecture section for the mid-term presentation. Polish the document as needed so it will align with our presentation.
- Begin coding frontend, do basic logic for login/register account flow and screen. Also configure routing in React.

**Team Member 2 (Ulises Cordova):**<br>
**Goals planned for this week:** Collecting all user data, compiling it individually, and inserting it into a high-level dataset. As well as help identify risk assessments and their risk, likelihood, and evidence of what, why, or how the risks are. 

**Team progress and issues:**
- During the weekly team meeting agreed on our project's architecture and assignedthe backend.
- Our team meetings were very valuable to me because everyone chimes in and is able to speak their mind on tasks completed and future work. Moving forward, we’ve set up a good foundation for starting the project. 
- How to implement data aggregation on Superbase and how to think and create risk assessments. 
- Learning about Superbase’s tools was a bit confusing and difficult to figure out at first, especially how we needed to connect and implement features with the group. 

**Goals planned for next week: (These are lower-level tasks for which this team member is accountable)**
- Start implementing front end, we have not fully split up our work yet (estimated time: 3 days) 
- Help in creating next week's presentation and be ready to present to class (estimated time: 2 days). 

**Team Member 3 (Rustic Boulton):**<br>
**Goals planned for this week:** Implemented GET /api/lessons/{lesson_id} for most of our lessons. Not 100% fully implemented just yet, but close to finishing. Being able to fetch a specific lesson using sql(SupaBAse) is what I have left to implement. I ran into a small problem at the beginning of the week with connecting SupaBase to Visual Studio Code, since I like to write all my code in the editor. Was able to resolve this with my group's help.

**Team progress and issues:**
- I started to write code for our lessons api an for the lesson ids. I did two sections for project 3 milestone: project schedule, and two sections for risk assessment. 
- We were able to figure out how to share, connect, and write our backend in SupaBase.
- Using cloud hosting with SupaBase was harder to navigate at first, but it seems to be very useful to us as we move forward. I found it to be a useful tool for writing in sql, and using the database(tables, functions). 
- It took us a bit of time to figure out how to connect/share the organization with each group member, as we had to figure out how to safely share it with each other.

**Goals planned for next week: (These are lower-level tasks for which this team member is accountable)**
- Work on the architecture section for mid-term presentation(Figma, Google Slides). We should polish our document so that it aligns with the presentation.
- Begin coding the frontend, basic logic for the login/register account flow, and screen. Also configure routing in React.

**Team Member 4 (Jackson Happel-Walvatne):**<br>
**Goals planned for this week:** Start implementing the start and submit POST/API processes for our program. Hopefully, testing some risk assessments tied to the specific parts of my tasks. 

**Team progress and issues:**
- Helped the team with finishing up the Assignment: “Project milestone 3.” Specifically, we divided up tasks to add to the finalized document. 
- All team members have a structured list of tasks to finish by specific, agreed-upon dates. 
- Researching and learning to implement agreed-upon programs to help build our project. 
- There was some miscommunication about what specific information the team wanted for risk assessments in the Milestone 3 assignment. I think this helped me understand what specific points and formats the team is actually looking for in our documentation. 

**Goals planned for next week:(These are lower-level tasks for which this team member is accountable)**
- Finish initializing the user’s practice session and submit the user’s practice results. Moving to the next phase of the project and assigning tasks to team members. (1–3 days)
- Testing the POST/API start and submit, and integration. (1-2 days)
