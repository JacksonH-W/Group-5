# Week 7: Requirements Elicitation

## Goals planned for this week:  
Get frontend pages implemented(dashboard, lessons, game, practice pages).  
Implement a few Python lessons to make sure the keyboard updates correctly with what the user inputs. 

## Team progress and issues:
- We have succesfully started on implementing frontend, and created documentation for both users and developers in initiating our current build how the strutcture of it as well. 
- The biggest success we have had is the frontend succesfully communicating with the backend which has made progress very smooth. We have not yet ran into any serious issues and dont plan as long as we stick to our planned goals. 
- As a team the biggest thing we learned is that it may be difficult to equally contribute the same on a weekly basis. This is not a problem but we have all need to have an equal impact on this project which we are progressing towards.  
- Our team's trouble comes from correctly documenting and commenting per pull/commit which is something we have discussed and are trying implement and initate as soon as possible.  

## Goals planned for next week: (These are higher-level tasks for the team)
- Have all basic features implemented and not worry about makeing it beautiful (yet). (Time est: 3 days) 
- Plan Test Suites for our code and defining boundaries. (Time est: 2 days)
- Implementing test suites and checking code coverage. (Time est: 3 days) 

# Contributions of individual team members

## Team Member 1 (Logan Bachman):

### Goals planned for this week:  
Implement testing & automation workflows  

### Team progress and issues:
Designed skeleton for frontend structure, and created login and registration pages with user routing based on authentication.  
Communication on team responsibilities, and being able to successfully implement my feature ahead of schedule.  
How to route with FastAPI’s sessions, and design a simple UI for our initial prototype.  
Could have been more thorough when designing developer documentation, needed revisions after the initial draft.  

### Goals planned for next week: 
Design my portion of testing automation (1 day)  
Create tests that provide efficient coverage (2-3 hours)  


## Team Member 2 (Ulises Cordova):

### Goals planned for this week: 
Create a Makefile that automates the startup process  
Copy over Supabase SQL queries into the repository so that other people can reproduce our project  
Functions  
Schemas  
Triggers  
Create a YML file that automates reporting issues with our code.  
Help front-end and build a page with the user's progress using api/GET/dashboard  

### Team progress and issues:
I was able to complete the backend and clean up repository documents, also created a makefile that automates start, and have copied over Supabase SQL queries.  
Communication has been working well, and everyone is contributing to the project on time and before our set deadlines, as well as the class deadlines. I feel that although we may have very busy schedule,s we are not overwhelming each other with too much work too fast and progressing with purpose and sense.  
I learned that you are able to run bash commands from a Makefile. Making it super easy to automate startups.  
I do not feel that I have been stuck; I only had to learn a bit about Makefiles and their possibilities.  

### Goals planned for next week: 
Create test suites for code, and check for code coverage.  
Makefile that reports stats for test suites.  


## Team Member 3 (Rustic Boulton):

### Goals planned for this week:  
Front-end: lessons/dashboard/game pages. Figure out the layout, lesson design, and the front-end look. Implement CSS styles for all pages and maintain a consistent UI look and feel throughout our project.  

### Team progress and issues:
I coded/implemented and updated multiple different frontend files(lessonsPage.jsx, practicePage.jsx, gamePage.jsx, Navbar.jsx, lessons.css, navbar.css, global.css, lessonsGrid.css, practice.css, app.jsx).  
The design for each page's layout is working nicely so far. We structured/split up the work differently this time from before. We split into two teams; two of us worked more on the coding/implementation part of the project, while the other two worked on style, design, look, and reorganization of our GitHub.  
We learned that we are not only on track with our project, but a little ahead, so we are starting to think about our stretch goal and what else we could add/implement after we are done with testing.  
A problem that I ran into was an issue with VSCode. Some files did not save, so I had to rewrite a few files. This is why we should save and push to git more often.  

### Goals planned for next week: 
Polish the frontend style and add a game with a few levels that correspond to specific lessons. (3 days)  
Restructure the practice mode so that it will take the user to a random lesson they have already finished(this will help them practice through repetition). (3 days).  


##Team Member 4 (Jackson Happel-Walvatne)

##Goals Planned for This Week:
Since this was the first week of structured task assignments, my primary goal was to support frontend–backend integration and begin implementing dynamic lesson functionality to ensure smooth communication between components.

##Team Progress and Issues:
Frontend-to-backend communication has been very smooth. Our API routes are functioning correctly, and the integration between FastAPI and the React frontend is stable. Once the API contracts were clearly defined, implementation became straightforward and efficient.

I gained a deeper understanding of managing frontend state in React, especially handling user input events and dynamically updating UI components based on lesson data. I also strengthened my understanding of how frontend components consume backend API responses and how important consistent route design is for scalable development.

The main challenge was structuring the practice logic so that lesson repetition, keyboard updates, and user progress tracking were synchronized correctly. It required restructuring part of the component logic to avoid unnecessary re-renders and state conflicts. Additionally, I am actively improving commit documentation and pull request descriptions with the team.

##What I worked on:
I focused on implementing and refining the Practice Page functionality, ensuring that lessons dynamically render based on user input and that the on-screen keyboard correctly updates according to lesson structure. I also helped verify that frontend API calls were successfully communicating with the backend endpoints, particularly for practice session initialization and submission logic.

##Goals Planned for Next Week:
Implement structured test cases for frontend practice functionality (including user input validation and lesson progression logic).
Time Estimate: 2 days

Refactor practice mode to support randomized review of completed lessons and ensure API integration remains stable.
Time Estimate: 2–3 days
