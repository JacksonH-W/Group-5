Week 5: Architecture and Design Team report:
 
**Goals planned for this week:** 
- Implementing our software design section (asynchronously) 
- Finalize software architecture (1-2 hours) 
- Split up tasks for the following week (1 day) 
- Develop the first initial structure of the backend (3-4 days)
**Team progress and issues:**
- We started to set up SupaBase for our backend. We set up the organization and sent invitations to each group member so we can all have access to the same cloud sharing application. We split up the workload evenly for project milestone 3 documentation. The coding section was also split up for the backend, using SupaBase’s SQL and database integration. 
- We figured out how to better communicate with each other and to hold each other accountable when 
- Learn how to use setup superbase and how to use superbase sql editor and its triggers, functions, and tables. 
- There was a little bit of miscommunication among spreading work, we were able to figure it out and move forward. Moving onwards we'll try to be a little more clear especially with assigning tasks. 
Goals planned for next week:  (These are higher-level tasks for the team)
- Finish mid-term presentation.
- Start on the front end, polish up any issues or unfinished features still outstanding with the backend.


**Contributions of individual team members:**
**Team Member 1 (Logan Bachman):**
- Goals planned for this week:  Implement user authentication and registration system.  Finish architecture section in living document.
Team progress and issues:
- Planned out architecture for the project, and got a task assigned for the backend implementation.
- Splitting up tasks between members, and making sure everyone had a relatively even amount of work.
- To be more clear about how to use certain frameworks or tools we are using (Ex: Supabase).
- Exactly how to format or communicate the way the architecture is working or communicating data, since been resolved.
Goals planned for next week:
- (These are lower-level tasks for which this team member is accountable)
- Work on the architecture section for mid-term presentation. Polish up the document as necessary so that it aligns with the presentation.
- Begin coding frontend, do basic logic for login/register account flow and screen. Also configure routing in React.


**Team Member 2 (Ulises Cordova):**
Goals planned for this week:  
- Collecting all user data, compiling it individually, and inserting it into a high-level dataset. As well as help identify risk assessments and their risk, likelihood, evidence of what, why or how the risks are risks. 
Team progress and issues:
- During the weekly team meeting agreed on our project's architecture and assignedthe  backend 
- I think that our team meetings are very valuable, and I enjoy that everyone chimes in and is able to speak their mind. I think that we are moving forward and have a good plan for starting the project. 
- How to implement data aggregation on Superbase and how to think and create risk assessments. 
- Something that was somewhat of trouble was the learning of superbase tools and how to connect and implement features into it. 
Goals planned for next week:  
- Start implementing front end, we have not fully split up our work yet (estimated time: 3 days) 
- Help in creating next week's presentation and be ready to present to class (estimated time: 2 days). 

**Team Member 3 (Rustic Boulton):**
Goals planned for this week:  
- Implemented GET /api/lessons/{lesson_id} for all lessons and be able to fetch a specific lesson using sql(SupaBAse). 
- We ran into a small problem at the beginning of 
Team progress and issues:
- I started to write code for our lessons api an for the lesson ids. I did two sections for 
- We were able to figure out 
- what team member learned
where team member had trouble and where team member is stuck
- Goals planned for next week:  (These are lower-level tasks for which this team member is accountable)


**Team Member 4 (Jackson Happel-Walvatne):**
Goals planned for this week:
- Start implementing the start and submit POST/API processes for our program. Hopefully, testing some risk assessments tied to the specific parts of my tasks. 
Team progress and issues:
- Helped the team with finishing up the Assignment: “Project milestone 3.” Specifically our divided up tasks to add to the finalized document. 
- All team members have a structured list of tasks to finish by specific, agreed-upon dates. 
- Researching and learning to implement agreed-upon programs to help build our project. 
- There was some miscommunication about what specific information the team wanted for risk assessments in the Milestone 3 assignment. I think this helped me understand what specific points and formats the team is actually looking for in our documentation. 
Goals planned for next week:
- (These are lower-level tasks for which this team member is accountable)
- Finish initializing the user’s practice session and submit the user’s practice results. Moving to the next phase of the project and assigning tasks to team members. (1–3 days)
- Testing the POST/API start and submit, and integration. (1-2 days)
