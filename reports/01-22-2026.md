## Team Report

- Last week we creating slideshow and preparing for our presentation, as well as creating our Project Requirements and features.
- What we did was divide up work and decide on our project as well as main features and the basic tech stack / architecture. We struggled with making sure work was divided up evenly and having every member attend meetings. We learned to be more thorough with our communication and that we need stricter rules in terms of responding to messages and our meetings.

**Plans for next week**
- Meet and plan out our project architecture and design document (One day)
- Do research into what architecture, tech stack, and tools best fit our project (2 hours)
- Finish out all the specifics for our design document asychronously (One day)
- Begin developing first backend feature (Two days)
