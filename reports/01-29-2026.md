## Team Report
**Last week's plan**
- Meet and plan out our project architecture and design document (One day)
- Do research into what architecture, tech stack, and tools best fit our project (2 hours)
- Finish out all the specifics for our design document asychronously (One day)
- Begin developing first backend feature (Two days)

Over the last week, we finalized our project architecture and design document. And did some initial research into what architecture and tools fit how we want to implement the project.
We assigned roles to each team member. We also planned out how we wanted to structure the learning, as well as how we can integrate the mini games into the individual lessons. In terms of things that didn't work or could be
improved on, include splitting up work / deciding who will work on what parts of the project (backend, frontend, auth, etc).

**In the following week we plan on:**
- Implementing our software design section (asynchronously)
- Finalize software architecture (1-2 hours)
- Split up tasks for following week (1 day)
- Develop first initial structure of the backend (3-4 days)
